# Obtain and build the code

Caliburn.Micro uses Git for source control. I highly recommend that you use the [GitHub Desktop client][gd].

### Build the code 
1. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Open `Caliburn.Micro.sln`.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B (or use the Build menu) to build the solution.
5. The assemblies will be generated in the `bin` directory under the root of the repository.
