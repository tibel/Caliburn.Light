# Caliburn.Light

Caliburn.Light is a fork of [Caliburn.Micro](https://github.com/caliburn-micro/caliburn.micro) that
- is modular/magic-free (does not include conventions)
- does not switch to UI thread automatically for everything
- integrates some ideas of [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) and [MVVMLight](https://github.com/lbugnion/mvvmlight) 
- uses weak events
- supports `ICommand` out-of-the-box
